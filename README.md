üìù Description

Delivery Logger is a comprehensive, multilingual mobile application built with React Native (Expo) designed for individuals and small businesses to efficiently track and manage package deliveries. The app provides a dynamic, at-a-glance dashboard, a detailed delivery list with search and filtering, and a guided multi-step form for adding new entries. All data is saved locally on the user's device for offline access and persistence.

This project was built as a portfolio piece to demonstrate a wide range of modern mobile development skills, including complex state management, dynamic UI, data persistence, and internationalization.
‚ú® Key Features

    Dynamic Dashboard: A high-level overview of all delivery statistics, including total counts, status breakdowns, and performance metrics.

    Full CRUD Functionality: Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete deliveries.

    Data Persistence: Utilizes AsyncStorage to save all delivery data directly on the device, ensuring information is never lost between sessions.

    Advanced Filtering & Search: The main deliveries list can be instantly filtered by status or priority, and searched by recipient name or tracking number.

    Multi-Step Form: A guided, user-friendly form for adding new deliveries, complete with validation and a progress indicator.

    Multilingual Support (i18n): The entire application is translated into English and French using i18next, with a language switcher for easy toggling.

    Custom Charting: A custom-built, dependency-free bar chart on the statistics screen to visualize the delivery breakdown.
